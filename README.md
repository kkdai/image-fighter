# Pixel Fighter

Pixel Fighter is a simple game written in Go that allows two players to battle against each other using images. The images are analyzed pixel by pixel to determine each player's stats, including HP, MP, STR, INT, and LUC.

# How to Play

- Prepare two images that are in JPEG format and are both sized at 1479 x 1109 pixels.
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixel-fighter.git
- Build the project: go build
- Run the game: ./pixel-fighter player1.jpg player2.jpg

The game will then display each player's stats and prompt you to input your moves. The player with higher stats will have a better chance of winning, but the winner is ultimately determined by a random roll of the dice.
